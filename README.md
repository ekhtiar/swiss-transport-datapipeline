# swiss-transport-datapipeline
A data pipeline to daily pull public transport data from the opentransportdata.swiss portal. This pipeline has three tasks, pull the right data from  opentransportdata.swiss, push the data to s3 for storage, and transform and load the transformed data to a database. Hopefully this repository helps people explain ETL / Batch data pipeline.
